		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>My name is Myron Richardson and I am an electrician starting my own LLC business with my two sons, Jahaizm and Kuron. I am taking this JavaScript class to learn web development skills so I can create and maintain a professional website for our family electrical contracting business.</p>
		
		<h2>Why I'm Taking This Class</h2>
		<p>I decided to enroll in this JavaScript course for several important reasons:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>To build a professional website for Rich Power Pro Electrical LLC</li>
			<li>JavaScript will make our business website interactive and user-friendly</li>
			<li>I want to handle our web presence in-house rather than hiring developers</li>
			<li>Learning web development will save money and give us control over our online presence</li>
			<li>These skills will benefit our family business in the digital marketplace</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>My Learning Goals</h2>
		<p>By completing this course, I plan to:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Master JavaScript fundamentals to enhance our business website</li>
			<li>Learn to create interactive contact forms and customer interfaces</li>
			<li>Understand jQuery for better user experience features</li>
			<li>Develop skills to maintain and update our website independently</li>
			<li>Apply JavaScript to showcase our electrical services effectively</li>
		</ol>
		
		<h2>Professional Background</h2>
		<p>I am a licensed electrician with 20+ years of experience in residential and commercial electrical work. I am currently establishing Rich Power Pro Electrical LLC as a family business with my sons Jahaizm and Kuron as business partners. While I have extensive knowledge in electrical systems, I am new to web development and excited to learn these digital skills to support our business growth.</p>
		
	        <h2>Business Goals</h2>
		<p>Our family electrical business is built on professionalism and integrity. Learning JavaScript will help me create a website that reflects these values and effectively communicates our expertise to potential customers. The website will serve as a digital portfolio of our services and help customers easily contact us for electrical work.</p>
		
		<h2>Course Expectations</h2>
		<p>I am committed to mastering the material in this class because it directly supports my business objectives. I understand that JavaScript is essential for modern web development, and I am prepared to put in the necessary time and effort to succeed in this course.</p>
